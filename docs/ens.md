# Ethereum Name Service

Since more and more DApps are depending on ENS,
we need to figure out how to handle this on the DMD.
For Example: Aragon depends on ENS.
Shall we in this case deploy ENS on DMD, 
register a ".dmd.eth" domain on ETH-Mainnet and DMD ?
how other sidechains are handling this ??
